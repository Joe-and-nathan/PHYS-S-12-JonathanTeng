   After not coming to class one day due to a fever (it was not covid, I got tested), I came to the horrifying realization that I may have skipped the singlemost imporatant class of the semester. I went in and saw everyone sawing and cutting with all these fancy equipment. I was asked to make something moving, so I decided to make a water pump that relies on the centrifugal force of circular motion.
   I connected the motor to make the spinning part of the pump which will lead the water to an exit.

After this, I enclosed the spinning part of the pump inside a plastic pipe and placed two lids on each side of the pipe. I drilled a hole through one of the lids to make the pipe fit through, and drilled a hole through the other to make it fit on the motor.

  Although the force was not as strong as I wanted it to be, I still felt satisfied that this idea works not only in theory, but also in an actual creation that I can make.
