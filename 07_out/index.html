  NEON TEXT GENERATOR WEBSITE IS DOWN TODAY, SORRY!

   After making my scale last time, I wanted to create something that would resemble an arcade machine that determined how hard a button is pressed.
   <div>
   </div>
   To do that, I linked up my last assignment to an led strip with this code:
   ```
   CODE
   ```

<div>
   </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="IMG_1435.gif" class=center>
  </div>
<div>
</div>
The shorter the distance is between the copper plates, the "higher" the LEDs will go.

<div>
   </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="./trim.92770442-99DD-4917-9A5D-F020B7E4FF8F.gif" class=center>
  </div>


 After that, I used an oscilloscope. Although the graph did not change because I am using an LED strip, looking at this GIF, it could be seen that the harder I press the button, the lower the frequency.
