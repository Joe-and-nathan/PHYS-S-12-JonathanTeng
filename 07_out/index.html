   After making my scale last time, I wanted to create something that would resemble an arcade machine that determined how hard a button is pressed.
   <div>
   </div>
   To do that, I linked up my last assignment to an led strip with this code:
   
<div>
   </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="crosssection.png" class=center>
  </div>
<div>
</div>
I created a 2D cross section like this then rotated it around the Y-Axis to make the 3D shape, I then made 4 more holes into it.

<div>
   </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="./IMG_1340.jpg" class=center>
  </div>


  This it what the final result looks like.

    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="./ezgif-3-daba4879bf.gif" class=center>

I connected it to a water motor that I bought yesterday. (The pump was for a fish tank, and yes, I went to a pet store despite owning no pets)

For the photogrammetry project, I decided to take a snapshot of my hand holding my project.
<div>
    Although a part of my hand and the nozzle itself was not rendered completely, the end result was still really cool.
