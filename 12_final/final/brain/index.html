   This is what the brain looks like. It looks very complex, so this is the schematic. (ALSO DONT WORRY I SWAPPED MOST OF THE EASY CLIPS WITH PIN-SOCKET WIRES SO THAT THE WHOLE THING DOESNT COST 600 DOLLARS TO MAKE)

 The brain is divided into two main parts, the thermistor and the motor. The brain also takes signals from the webpage generated by itself. This input is the desired temperature of the helmet. When the actual temperature is greater than this value, the motor starts spinning. The brain is powered by a 5V battery pack.

This is the thermistor (or rather, what it is connected to; the actual thermistor is barely outside of the frame) On the helmet, the thermistor is dangled down into the inside of the helmet in order to get a more accurate representation of the wearer's temperature.

This is the segment that is connected to a L9110 motor driver. This is what makes the actual water pump activate.

This is the code for the entire device:
