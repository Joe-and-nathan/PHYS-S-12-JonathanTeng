The helmet works with a water pump pumping water through these copper pipes:

  </div>

Laying the pipes was easy, but making a working water motor was definitively the hardest part of this assignment.

  </div>

This was my first water pump. This took around 7 hours to make. I originally intended for it to be submerged under water. However, I measured the current and realized that its around 3.2A, which is a LETHAL DOSE. So I decided to make a peristaltic pump instead.

However, this pump did not work either, as the motor did not have enough force to move it. At this point, I have already spent ~15 hours on pumps. Therefore, the professor approved me to use a store-bought pump instead.

HOWEVER...
The storebought pump that uses wires to connect somehow broke a day before the project was due! Therefore, for all who are going to test out the project on August second, I would hook up ANOTHER store bought pump that (unfortunately) cant be hooked up to my code.
    Although the final project took me ~40 hours to make, it was technically still not complete (THE PUMP BROKE ON THE LAST MINUTE!). Therefore, I am not satisfied. However, I have ordered a peristaltic pump and would incorporate it as soon as it arrives. This journey not only to make this project but throughout this entire class was something that I will never forget. I want to thank each and every person in this classroom for creating this experience.
