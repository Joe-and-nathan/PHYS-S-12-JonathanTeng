  I teamed up with Varun to make a remote-controlled temperature regulating system. (doesnt regulate it yet)
  How it work is basically that an input of a desired temperature could be entered on a website and if the actual temperature is greater than the entered temperature, a pin would be set to HIGh (LED used here, but useful for a motor in a fan) This is the code

  ```
  CODE
  ```

The most difficult part was converting char into int, but I just recoded and took some inspiration from online.

The website also updates real-time!
