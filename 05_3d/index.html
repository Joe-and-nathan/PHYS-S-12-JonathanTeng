   After making my water pump last time, I have realized that I wanted to make a fountain, and a key component in a fountain is the nozzle, which affects how the water comes out. Therefore, I created a 3d model of a five-hole nozzle.

    <div class="col-sm-4">
         <img alt="INTRO" src="crosssection.png" class=center>
  </div>

I created a 2D cross section like this then rotated it around the Y-Axis to make the 3D shape, I then made 4 more holes into it.

  </div>


  This it what the final result looks like.

I connected it to a water motor that I bought yesterday. (The pump was for a fish tank, and yes, I went to a pet store despite owning no pets)

For the photogrammetry project, I decided to take a snapshot of my hand holding my project.

    Although a part of my hand and the nozzle itself was not rendered completely, the end result was still really cool.
